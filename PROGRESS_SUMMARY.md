# Progress Summary

Date: 2026-03-05
Repo: `prompt-sentinel`
Roadmap Source: `Compliance-SDK-Plan-Forward-v3.md`
Execution Mode: Phase-by-phase production hardening

## Current Stage Outcome

This stage advanced **Phase 2 key lifecycle hardening** on top of the existing auth/RBAC bootstrap.

### Completed in this stage

- Added credential lifecycle operations in auth service:
  - generate credential tokens
  - revoke credentials by `key_id`
  - expire credentials by `key_id`
- Added key expiry + revocation enforcement in request authorization.
- Added default key TTL support for generated credentials (`AUTH_DEFAULT_KEY_EXPIRY_SECS`).
- Added persistent file-backed auth credential storage (`AUTH_KEY_STORE_PATH`) so key lifecycle changes survive restarts.
- Added credential metadata state fields:
  - `expires_at`
  - `revoked_at`
  - `active`
- Extended auth admin APIs:
  - `POST /api/auth/keys/generate`
  - `POST /api/auth/keys/revoke`
  - `POST /api/auth/keys/expire`
  - existing `POST /api/auth/keys/rotate` now also accepts `expires_in_seconds`
- Updated server auth error handling for revoked/expired tokens.
- Added auth unit tests for:
  - expiry and revoke enforcement
  - generated key persistence round-trip
  - default expiry behavior
- Updated docs/examples (`README.md`, `.env.example`) for lifecycle endpoints and new env vars.

## Detailed Mapping: Roadmap Checklist Progress

### Phase 0

- Completed:
  - CORS allowlist lockdown.
  - Security headers middleware.
  - Health probes (`live`, `ready`, `startup`).
  - Graceful shutdown.
  - Connection pooling + timeout controls.
  - Circuit breaker for upstream LLM calls.
  - TLS termination guide.
  - `cargo audit` GitHub Actions workflow.
- Remaining:
  - Secret managers (Vault/AWS/K8s).
  - `cargo-fuzz` harness.
  - OpenTelemetry + tracing exporters.
  - Sentry integration.
  - SLI/SLO dashboard assets.
  - Chaos and contract test infrastructure.

### Phase 1

- Completed:
  - `LLMProvider` trait.
  - OpenAI-compatible backend support.
  - Anthropic-compatible backend support.
  - Config-driven provider switching via env.
- Remaining:
  - Capability router and fallback chains.
  - Cost-aware and region-aware routing.
  - Model pinning policy enforcement.
  - Dedicated Ollama/vLLM local ops workflows.

### Phase 2

- Completed:
  - API key authentication.
  - Service account token support.
  - RBAC route permission checks.
  - Per-key scopes.
  - Per-key rate limiting.
  - Runtime credential generation/rotation/revoke/expire workflows.
  - Credential expiry + revoke enforcement at auth middleware boundary.
  - Persistent file-backed auth key store.
  - Auth access log retrieval.
- Remaining:
  - OAuth 2.0 / OIDC integrations.
  - mTLS auth support.
  - Resource-level permissions.
  - Access event audit expansion.
  - Full multi-tenant isolation and quotas.

## Validation

Commands run for this stage:

- `cargo fmt` -> pass
- `cargo check` -> pass
- `cargo test` -> pass (all suites green; benchmark test intentionally ignored)

## Files Changed This Stage

- `src/modules/auth/mod.rs`
- `src/config/settings.rs`
- `src/server.rs`
- `tests/multilingual_response_test.rs`
- `.env.example`
- `README.md`
- `PROGRESS_SUMMARY.md`

## Next Execution Slice

1. Start OAuth/OIDC provider abstraction (Auth0/Okta/Azure AD/Keycloak-ready) with pluggable verifier interfaces.
2. Persist auth access audit events into the main audit evidence layer (durable and queryable).
3. Introduce resource-level permissions scaffold (project/environment dimension) as the first multi-tenant control.
